                <div class="faq_content">
                    <p>Absolutely! This is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found, however, that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall 
                        (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be 
                        bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly, we deal with very few bored children of any age! 
                        <br><br> The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep
                        things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at 
                        all without telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

                <div class="faq_content">
                    <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with 
                        at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. <br><br>
                        Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). 
                        Many non-swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what 
                        you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

                    <p>Everything! What's not to love about whitewater rafting? Let's dive into a typical day on the river. <br><br>

                        Start your day in the gentle glow of the early morning, having spent the night under a breathtaking starry sky. 
                        Enjoy a delicious and filling breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or made-to-order omelets. Then, gather your 
                        belongings and get ready for the adventure ahead. The day is brimming with thrilling whitewater, serene stretches, 
                        invigorating hikes, fascinating stories, glimpses into history and geology, and of course, mouthwatering meals. <br><br>
                        
                        Around 4 or 5 pm, we aim to reach our campsite. After setting up your cozy cot, unwind by the riverside with a captivating 
                        book or engaging company. You can explore the camp surroundings while your guides skillfully prepare a delectable dinner, 
                        such as sizzling steak and potatoes or grilled salmon. And let's not forget the pièce de résistance—dutch oven brownies that 
                        will leave an unforgettable mark on your taste buds! <br><br>
                        
                        As the evening progresses, savor moments of relaxation and perhaps convince your guide to share a few more captivating 
                        stories before you retire for the night. Fall asleep under a sky adorned with more stars than you ever imagined possible!</p>
