    <h2>Gayle Davie</h2>
    <p>G'day mates! My name is Gayle and I don't really have a nickname. Although I am often remembered by my maiden name, Reyna
    (which translates to Queen in my native language). I was born in the Philippines, but I now live in Brisbane, Australia with my
    eternal companion and our beautiful baby boy. Our son is turning three this year, but he's my forever baby. I am also a third-generation
    member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. 
    </p>
    <p>I currently work for a scale-up FinTech company as the head of our Customer Success team. I studied Doctor of Dental Medicine for three years, before
    switching to a career in Jewellery Sales and Design. I am a certified Applied Jewellery Professional with the Gemological Institute of America. After a couple
    of years trying to find my passion, I am now trying to complete an associate degree in Applied Technology while I wait for my Australian citizenship. 
    I want to get a Bachelor's in Software Engineering at a local university as soon as education becomes free for me.
    </p>
    <p>I am really excited to formally learn web design. I remember learning HMTL and CSS in high school, and how I enjoyed it a lot. I like arts and craft, and although
    I haven't had the time to, I also love to paint and create digital art (so I don't have to clean up after myself all the time  ðŸ˜…).
    </p>
    <p>I look forward to a wonderful semester with everyone!</p>
